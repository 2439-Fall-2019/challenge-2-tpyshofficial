	<h1> The New Pornographers-In The Morse Code of Brake Lights review</h1>
	<p>Alternative rock and indie rock are both genres with which I have a…difficult relationship, might be the best way to put it. 
	I’ve always been a fan of rock and roll of just about all varieties, and within the bounds of indie rock, acts such as The National have risen to high esteem with me. 
	What’s always been particularly appealing about alt rock and to a lesser extent indie is just how varied they can be, given just how fuzzy those very classifications can get. 
	Acts in the alternative scene have historically pulled from a wide range of influences spanning decades.</p>
	</br>
	<p>That’s what alt rock used to be, anyway. During the turn of the decade, the whole scene began to undergo something of a metamorphosis, and not one for the better in my view. Many acts began to simplify or shift their sound to experiment with throwback pop, funk, electronica, or some combination of the three. If this were just one or two acts this wouldn’t really be an issue, and wouldn’t even be unheard of, but as the 2010s went on more and more of the scene made this exact same jump, until very little of what the scene used to be was even left. Not everything that came out of this transformation was bad, in fact some acts seemed to benefit from the transition, but this homogenization still rings as a shame to me.</p>
	</br>
	<p>All of that brings us to The New Pornographers, a band originally set up to be something like an alt rock supergroup, though many of it’s members didn’t have much of a profile before it. I wasn’t really familiar with the group before I set out to review this most recent project, and it became clear rather quickly that I’d need a bit more context to give this album a fair assessment. With that in mind, I checked out the group’s first, and what many would consider their best, three albums, 2000’s Mass Romantic, 2003’s Electric Version and 2006’s Twin Cinema, along with their most recent album before this, Whiteout Conditions back in 2017, and well I’m glad I did, both because it did end up giving me some additional framing for a project that I really didn’t know what to make of, and because this band really does have some classics in their back catalogue, especially on those first three albums, I highly recommend them all, and Whiteout Conditions isn’t half-bad either.</p>
	</br>
	<p>More than that though, they each served to give some context into exactly what this band’s deal is. Early on they had a focus on fast-paced rock with clear influences both from punk and especially the rock music of the late sixties. As time went on, they tightened up their production and started mixing in more and more elements of power pop, as well as eventually synth pop, but they never really lost sight of their roots.</p>
	</br>
	<p>This brings us to 2019 with In The Morse Code of Brake Lights. On this newest project, the band seems not to be terribly interested in their old rock and roll or even really their pop influences, instead drawing inspiration primarily from their contemporaries in alt rock. As a direct result this album ends up falling into the same trap many of those very contemporaries have over the years, which I described before. That doesn’t necessarily mean that the album is lackluster on it’s own though, like I said there are some acts that pull off this transition very well, this wasn’t dead on arrival. All of that said though, what did I see In The Morse Code of Brake Lights?</p>
	</br>
	<p>Honestly, not a whole lot, and going back to the band’s earlier work only soured me further on this thing. Though, technically speaking, the band has toned down the number of synths in comparison to Whiteout Conditions, the group has never felt so artificial. The album sounds nice at points, if utterly overproduced, but there’s no bite here. On it’s own this might not necessarily even be a major issue but a lot of this overly bright production lacks even a semblance of a backbone, and so just comes off as obnoxious a lot of the time. There are a few points where it does and things almost start to work as intended. Colossus of Rhodes manages by adding some more fast-paced lower tones and a bit quicker and meatier percussion, though that song is essentially ruined by the introduction of really bizarre and out-of-place string swells. One Kind of Solomon probably gets by the best on the strength of it’s melody and a deceptively addictive chorus alone, and the same goes for the opening track.</p>
	</br>
	<p>Those strings appear all over the album, and with maybe a single exception, they come off as a bizarre quirk of overproduction more than anything, with the exception of the previously-mentioned Colossus of Rhodes where they’re outright obnoxious. That said, besides a few glaring example (see the glass bottle sounds on Opening Ceremony, though I guess I understand why they’re there(?)) most of the production here is less obnoxious than limp and forgettable. It sounds pleasant at first, but by you’re second listen it all becomes background noise, and not even background noise that you subconsciously derive any sort of joy from, sans a few highlights. Even the highlights here can’t claim to stand alongside songs like Letter From An Occupant, From Blown Out Speakers, or Jackie Dressed In Cobras.</p>
	</br>
	<p>In terms of vocals, A.C. Newman is…fine, he’s never really been the vocal highlight of the group, and that’s been all the more apparent ever since they lost Daniel Bejar of Destroyer fame, and of course Neko Case has nothing to prove to anyone, least of all me. I just wish she was utilized for more than supporting or wispy, wistful vocals more often.</p>
	</br>
	<p>And that probably makes it time to talk about Newman’s writing, and again…it’s not bad? The band tries to mix in various big ideas and concepts into lyrics that mainly deal in aimless nihilism, which is…often pretty jarring.. The main theme the album seems to be trying to go for is something about how dangerous and unfulfilling the rockstar lifestyle actually is, and I’m sorry but am I really supposed to swallow that this is new, mature territory for this group? I remember Use It all the way back in 2006. And again, all of that seems to be seeped in an ironic detachment that’s often times hard to stomach for extended periods of time, especially on something like Higher Beams, one of the lyrically better tracks until you get to the absurdly tone-deaf chants of “fuck you for nothing” which are, frankly, impossible to take seriously. The clear lyrical highlight would be something like One Kind of Solomon, which makes the best use of some of those big ideas and references, mostly just by being willing to fully commit to them.</p>
	</br>
	<p>Honestly, that single song contains most of the album’s best moments, though there are a couple other cuts I don’t mind listening to from time to time. That said I think I’ll forget about this album pretty quickly. The overall experience is extremely mediocre, and given what The New Pornographers have put forward in the past, incredibly disappointing for me. That said, a lot of other people seem to really like it if the Metacritic score is anything to go by, so maybe it’s just me. Overall I give this album a 4/10, bordering on a five. Maybe if you’re really into these vocalists, or if this is the exact kind of pop you enjoy listening to you’ll find something you like here, but I really can’t see myself recommending this to anyone anytime soon.</p>
