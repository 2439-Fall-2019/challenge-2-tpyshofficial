	<h1>Tool-Fear Inoculum review</h1>
	<p>Considering my love of  prog rock, it’s a little odd that I haven’t listened to all that much Tool. Here’s a band that essentially defined the genre for a decade, and that was many people’s first experience with it, and I’ve never taken the time to explore their catalogue. Sure, Lateralus had a couple songs I enjoy, but I haven’t even listened to that album in full. I’m a little embarrassed, honestly.</p>
	</br>
	<p>This left me in an odd position going into Fear Inoculum. Much of the discourse surrounding this album has been centered around the expectations Tool fans had for it, and how it compares to the band’s back catalogue, a whole lot of context I, for the most part, lack. Most of what I had was from years of secondhand hype for the band or preconceptions cultivated by listening to a lot of prog rock. I was under the impression this would be a dense and complex album I’d need to devote several listens to digging into, and that’s exactly the approach I took to it. So what did I find at the core of Fear Inoculum.</p>
	</br>
	<p>Well, if I can be honest, I tried really hard to like this album more than I did. Not for the sake of impressing anyone, I don’t exactly run with a crowd of massive Tool fans or anything, but because as I listened through it for the first time, there were a lot of really potent moments of brilliance and inspiration, and it almost felt unfair to those moments to rag on it too much. I gave it chance after chance waiting for all the parts that didn’t work for me to finally fall into place, and for me to finally “get it”. But, as I began my sixth listen, it became very clear that those parts were never going to start working.</p>
	</br>
	<p>And that’s really a shame, because even now those moments of brilliance really shine through for me. There’s clearly a lot of thought poured into a song like Descending, one of the few songs on the album that really justifies it’s absurd length. Through all twelve minutes of it’s run it builds on and references back to itself, cultivating some real atmosphere in the process, especially with Maynard James Keenan’s incredibly expressful vocal performance, it can seriously be breathtaking at some points of this song. Any band who can pull that off, even inconsistently, deserves some level of respect in my opinion, and now you might begin to see where some of my second guessing came from.</p>
	</br>
	<p>It’s incredibly strange when compared to songs like Invincible or the title track, both of which start out strong, but quickly reveal themselves for what they are: overly bloated tracks that go on for ten minutes plus, bouncing between jarringly disparate musical segments with no regard for cohesion, consistency or even natural-sounding transitions.  A criticism like this might seem odd, especially being as big of a fan of The Mars Volta as I am, but typically The Mars Volta would use those jarring moments of contrast for the sake of some kind of message, such as on songs like Tetragrammaton or Cygnus, Vismund Cygnus. If there’s a greater point here, I’ve been unable to find it. If any song kind of does this right, it’d be Pneuma, which is itself another standout track. The songs haunting, melancholy main riff fades away to be replaced by the sound of tribal drums contrasted against industrial buzzing, only for that riff to cut back in as a far more visceral version of itself later. It’s a fantastic microcosm of the album’s instrumental themes and, unfortunately, one of the only times they’re really successfully implemented.</p>
	</br>
	<p>Let’s dissect those themes for a moment. Throughout the album, naturalistic and industrial elements are contrasted with and played off of each other. This can be heard in the previously mentioned Pneuma, as well as the title track, but where it really shows most is on the interludes. And, that makes it time to finally talk about those interludes, and by extension what are unquestionably the album’s low points. As said before, I can at least appreciate what role they serve thematically, with the distorted birdcall on Mockingbeat being the most obvious example, but that doesn’t excuse them for being misplaced, misused and often low-effort. They range from the technically impressive but ultimately inconsequential Chocolate Chip Trip, to the forgettable Legion Inoculant, to the utter unintentional silliness of Litanie contre la Peur. Not one of them flows from or into anything, and ending the album with Mockingbeat of all tracks, an interlude built out of annoying percussion and even more annoying everything else, is a decision I can’t justify in my head no matter how hard I try.</p>
	</br>
	<p>And as I’m writing this I realize I seem like I’m filled with vitriol towards this album, but I’m really not. Even on the songs that end up feeling so-so for me (and outside of the interludes that’s as bad as any track on the album ever gets) there are elements I really like. I can appreciate the intensity on a song like 7empest or the more subtle tone of a song like Culling Voices, even if both of those songs run way longer than they should, or the masterful vocal delivery throughout most of Invincible, even if that song suffers from a serious lack of cohesion as I said before, the title track had the same problem but the ethereal quality of the first few minutes makes for a legitimately fantastic starting point for the rest of the album, and Pneuma and Descending are two songs I can’t praise highly enough. Masterful craftsmanship shows through all throughout this album, but it’s marred by a series of backwards decisions. On that topic though, Tool is a band known for their surreal album-long explorations of esoteric concepts, a la mathematical spirituality on Lateralus. With that in mind, why in hell is this thing so damn non-cohesive? Songs do not lead into one another, instrumentally or even lyrically or thematically, and the interludes certainly do nothing to help.</p>
	</br>
	<p>That might be just the slightest bit unfair, though. I’ve mentioned the instrumental themes already, but there do exist some common ideas tying things together lyrically as well. In essence, Fear Inoculum takes the ideas of new age spirituality and transcendence that Tool and the many prog acts that imitated them have indulged in so frequently in the past, and changes the framing a bit to add some level of urgency to it all. This is most apparent in a song like Descending, which describes an approaching do-or-die moment where we will have to choose between complacency and extinction. 7empest has a bit of a narrower focus, acting as a scathing condemnation of those who would preach and sell a, in the band’s words, “dubious state of serenity” while fully aware that do-or-die moment, that tempest, is only getting closer, while something like Pneuma is a bit more subtle about it. The song preaches the same ideas of ascending flesh and attuning yourself to the world and the spirit that prog rock bands in Tool’s vein have paid reference to for a long time, but the slow, ominous guitars and hushed, almost fearful whisper-singing paint the whole thing as more of a desperate plea than some kind of teaching moment (and honestly that clever bit of framing saves the whole song, keeping it from seeming as condescending as it very easily could have).</p>
	</br>
	<p>But then you have songs which seem utterly disinterested in this thematic thru-line, which only serves to emphasize the album’s previously-mentioned issues with cohesion. Take Invincible, a song about a “warrior” past his prime fighting desperately to maintain some semblance of relevance and, while I have remarkably little patience for hearing old rock stars describing the plight of the washup, coming from a prog rock band, a genre which has always projected this idea of advancing the sound whether or not the masses could keep up, it just seems utterly bizarre. Culling Voices is another major lyrical diversion, though in both it’s case and Invincible’s the writing itself is fine, if way too on-the-nose considering Tool’s writing seems to get better the more cryptic it tries to be.</p>
	</br>
	<p>Again, I feel like I’m being too harsh here. There is tons of potential and even legitimately great execution throughout, but all of it is weighed down by the misguided, forgettable and occasionally even actively annoying connective tissue. After considering everything, Fear Inoculum gets a strong 6/10 from me and a recommendation only to Tool fans or people who just love all prog rock unconditionally. There are certainly full tracks I can recommend almost universally, but as a front-to-back listen…I think most people would be better served looking elsewhere, even if most people probably will still enjoy themselves some.</p>
